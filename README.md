## **Linear Algebra for Data Science**

ðŸ“– **Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of the Miuul - Linear Algebra for Data Science and Machine Learning course. The objective of the project was to apply the linear algebra concepts covered in the course to a real-world dataset. Using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Regression, this project demonstrates how linear algebra can solve complex data science problems.
Through this project, I showcased my understanding of:

Dimensionality reduction techniques with PCA.

Building and evaluating machine learning models using Linear Regression.

Performance evaluation and interpretation of machine learning models.

This project contributes to earning the certification provided by Miuul, validating my data science and machine learning expertise.

ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**

To explore the diabetes dataset and understand its structure.

To reduce the dimensions of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) while retaining key information.

To build a multivariable Linear Regression model for predicting target values.

To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R2 Score.

To visualize the results and interpret key insights.


ðŸ”§ **Technologies Used**

Python 3.9+

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

scikit-learn: For PCA, regression modeling, and performance metrics.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For data visualization.


ðŸ“Š **Steps in the Workflow**

**1. Data Selection**

Dataset: Diabetes dataset from Scikit-learn.

Features: 10 independent variables (age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.).

Target: A quantitative measure of diabetes progression.

**2. Data Exploration and Cleaning**

Verified dataset structure using basic statistics.

Confirmed there were no missing values.

**3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**

Reduced the dataset dimensions from 10 features to 5 principal components.

The first 5 components explained 88% of the variance.

**4. Linear Regression Modeling**

Built a Linear Regression model using the reduced data.

Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing subsets.

**5. Model Evaluation**

Performance Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): <code>2879.59</code>

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): <code>43.29</code>

R2 Score: <code>0.46</code>

**Visualizations:**

1.Actual vs Predicted Values plot

2.Error Distribution plot


**ðŸŒ„ Key Results**

- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA successfully reduced the datasetâ€™s dimensions while retaining most of the information.

- Model Performance: The Linear Regression model explained 46% of the variance in the target variable.

- Improvement Potential: Observed systematic errors in higher target values, indicating areas for improvement.


**ðŸ”§ Future Work**

- Advanced Models:

Experiment with Ridge, Lasso Regression, or more complex machine learning models such as Random Forest.

- Feature Engineering:

Explore creating new meaningful features from the existing dataset.

- Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize the modelâ€™s parameters to improve performance.

- Larger Dataset:

Work with a more extensive or diverse dataset to enhance the modelâ€™s generalizability.
